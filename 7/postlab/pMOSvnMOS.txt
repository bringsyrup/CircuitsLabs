I ran the simulation in spice using pMOS transistors first with V_b = 4.4V for
achieving moderate inversion, then with V_b = 3.7V (nMOS was 1.3V, so this is
the approximate equivilent) to achieve strong inversion in the bias
transistor. For moderate inversion, I swept V_1 from -.3 to .3 volta above
V_2, which was set to 1V, 2V, and 3V. The data is scaled quite differently for
moderate inversion (the max for I_b in nMOS was around 1.25e-6A, whereas the
min I_b for pMOS is about -4.5e-9A), but the range of V_1 - V_2 over which the dominating
current switches from one output current to the other is from about -120mV -
120mV for both nMOS and pMOS. The scaling may have to do with the difference
in V_T0 for both devices (aka, I don't really know if the pMOS was in weak or
moderate inversion with V_b set to 4.4V).

In strong inversion, once again the magnitude of the current drawn is smaller
by two orders of magnitude for the pMOS, but both the nMOS and pMOS experience
the swap of I_b in the range -.6V < V_1 - V_2 = .6V.  

In both week and strong inversion, the node voltage behaves as expected
for the pMOS, following whichever differential transistor is carrying I_b.
